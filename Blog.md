#Novel and Genre Evlolution in the Early Modern Period

In Franco Moretti’s Graphs, Maps, Trees first chapter, Abstract Models for Literary history, Moretti delivers his argument through quantitative data. The main core of his argument is that genres, particularly in British novels, tend to last for short generations generally 25 years before making way for new genres to rise in popular culture. Moretti takes the historical quantitative data (publications per year mostly) and effectively visualizes it into graphs/timelines to support his argument through making clear fluctuations of genre trends over time. One of the points that Moretti made clear is that changes in genre trends and novel publications were generally caused by politics (Moretti 72). This is best exemplified in the various dip of novel publications in Britain, France, Denmark, Japan and Italy (Moretti 71-74). It does makes sense the weight of influence politics had on novel publications, wars that required countries to come into a state of “total war” such as the Napoleonic War or censorship campaigns such as those in Japan clearly made greatly reduced novel publications (Moretti 72). However, after these political events had passed, novels returned or increased upon the number of publications prior to the political event (Moretti 72). These impacts of politics on novel publications leads to the idea of the social implications of politics that would transcend novel publications. Comparatively, Tara McPherson promptly notes in her paper, Why Are the Digital Humanities So White? or Thinking the Histories of Race and Computation, how the development of UNIX must be adaptive to the political landscape (McPherson).

*"…society is reorganizing due to pressures within the political field (i.e., due to social movements), and that race is a particularly important vector in this reorganization. Second, all technological change is deeply situated within cultural forces, and, thus, the development of UNIX needs to be read in relation to these changes even if the relationship is not one of strict linear causality."*


 I feel Moretti strongly conveys this relationship through is argument.  In Moretti’s description of the three rises of British novels he effectively touches on how there is an alteration on the type of novels in demand. He reveals this by touching on the culture of British readers and how they will skim over multiple books at one rather than reading fewer books more intensely. From this large apatite for novels it would not take long for readers to out pace the release of novels to which caused old books to become popular. This trend collapses however when novel publications double. This insight acts as a smooth segway to his main argument of how novel genres develop and change within Britain. A passage from Ralph W. Rader’s The Emergence of the Novel in England demonstrates Rader’s take on McKeon’s and Watt’s concept of novels (Rader 77). 

*"McKeon's notion of the novel as synthesizing questions of truth and questions of virtue might be taken as, like Watt's, pointing to the same novelistic modality that I have been defining, though falling greatly short of precision and fullness in its account of the distinctiveness of the form as imaginatively experienced. This is owing to his commitment to a method that looks to understand all socio-cultural phenomena as the outgrowth of a dialectically continuous development according to which any epiphenomenal cultural trends are determined in the long run by more fundamental economic and social forces. This view stands in contrast to my own approach, which sees history as the emergent result of aggregate human action, with what constructively comes before conditioning and enabling what comes after, and with the individual embodied human person assigned a more important role in the development at least of cultural phenomena like literature." (77)*

Rader makes it clear that, in his opinion, the development of novels and literature are based upon the personas of individuals as well as sharing a collective development from all human actions. I feel that there is a correlation between the development of novels and the development of novel genres as both are influenced by similar variables within culture, politics, economics, and social forces. Returning to Moretti’s paper and his analysis of British genres, he analysed over 100 studies of British genre and concluded that 44 genres emerged between 1740 and 1900. What is curious is that the genres did not arise at a generally consistent rate but rather through bursts usually every few decades (Moretti 80). These bursts of new genres resulted in the fading of some genres during the same period (Moretti 80). This advancement of genres in what Moretti calls a “changing of the guard” like pattern demonstrates the generational qualities that genres have (Moretti 80).

This Voyant text analysis (Figure 1) demonstrates how Moretti used words to make his core arguments. As a singular, Moretti uses “novel” whenever he wishes to demonstrate qualitative data and describe novels through uses of adjectives and verbs. In a plural form, “novels” is typically used when describing qualitative data whether it is a year or quantity of publications. Lastly, Moretti uses “genres” much like “novels” among quantitative data whether in a graph or through language. Through out his paper, Moretti clearly defines just how genres progress throughout British literature history which gives insight on our modern society and how the many social forms can change similarly overtime whether in literature, film, fashion, cuisine, music, alcohol, etc. This is evident through the past decade of rebooted movie franchises from the past or the rise of shawarma becoming a popular cuisine over the past two decades.  

If there is one thing I must criticize in Moretti’s paper is the pool labelling of his graphs and timelines. The charts would have been much clearer if the y-axis numbers were always clearly labelled rather then the touching on the meaning amongst the description which is combined with the citation. However, despite these poorly designed graphs, Moretti provides a well thought out and demonstrated argument of the evolution of novels and genres during the early modern period.

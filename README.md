# Kevin Pendergast's IASC 2P02 
## Research Statement
  

  I am a 21 year old second year Interactive Arts and Science student attending Brock University. Currently, my interests within the digital humanities are within the creative side. I do not see myself graduating IASC with a concentration in Digital Scholarship, however there is many things I admire from the digital humanities which I would love to use for future projects. Firstly, using various visualizers to analyse statistics in various ways to demonstrate correlation and meaning for readers to better understand. This interest within digital visualization comes from my use of the website Last.fm which is a music listening tracker which has various tools to compile one’s listening history in different charts and graphs. Secondly, I am a big fan of educational videos on YouTube which effectively make video essays to make arguments. I can foresee myself using my creative skills within video editing to make a video essay within the future. Based off these interests, if I were to pursuit an area of the digital humanities it would be data visualization. A project that I completed this year which exemplifies this area of digital humanities would be the collaborative project I participated in. The tool which my group and I researched and presented was Palladio. Palladio is a historical data visualization tool which features tools that visualize and compare time, geographical, and personal data. If I was to take this specialization into a career, I would love to analyse speech data. This could be very useful for example within politics where collecting and analysing politician rhetoric could give insight on how certain politicians convey their ideas or arguments differently.

#### Collaborative Project
###### *Project Discription*
During the collaborative project I participated in, I helped research and present my group’s digital humanities project, Palladio, a data analysis tool developed through Stanford University. Palladio is a robust historical data analysis tool which our group found to be a versatile tool which could visualize and compare data in interesting ways. The data our group used to demonstrate, collected by Aaron Coomber, was a collection of famous writers’ personal data including: death date, birthdate, place of death, place of birth, sex, name, occupation, and pictures. There were various fascinating visualizations we could find using the tool such as using Palladio’s map tool to demonstrate the distance between some writer’s place of birth and death. As great of a tool as Palladio is, we also discovered some issues with the tool.  Such issues can be evident in its failure to work properly is some internet browsers.

###### *Collaboration Statement*
How our group approached collaborative scholarship by having a steady line of communication both in-person and online. During the early meetings in class, my group and I discussed which tool we wanted to research and present. As a group, we split up the suggested digital humanities tools within the project outline to research. We each spoke about the tools we researched to rest of the group and whether it would be a good tool to present. After our group selected Palladio as our tool, we split up which areas of focus each of our group would cover. We decided everyone’s role based on what each of us interests and strengths. My role was to analyse and present Palladio’s Table, Gallery, Timeline and Timespan tools. I believe that collaboration is essential for thinking and working in an academic setting. Collaboration demands communication, organization, teamwork, leadership, and project management skills. These skills are vital, not only in academics, but also once I am within the workforce. Two digital tools I will typically use in collaborative tasks are Google Docs and Slides which make it easy for any group member to edit or add to any document or slideshow. Within the digital humanities, I make sure that there are clear lines of communication among fellow group members. This is the most important aspect of a collaborative project as with strong communication organization, teamwork and project management become much easier to achieve. With this approach to collaborative projects, I have found research and overall tasks much easier to complete. This is also evident for how collaborative projects fail which I have participated in. This is seen where some group members do not communicate with others which makes management, organization and functional teamwork extremely difficult.

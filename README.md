## Research Statement
  

  I am a 21 year old second year Interactive Arts and Science student attending Brock University. Currently, my interests within the digital humanities are within the creative side. I do not see myself graduating IASC with a concentration in Digital Scholarship, however there is many things I admire from the digital humanities which I would love to use for future projects. Firstly, using various visualizers to analyse statistics in various ways to demonstrate correlation and meaning for readers to better understand. This interest within digital visualization comes from my use of the website Last.fm which is a music listening tracker which has various tools to compile one’s listening history in different charts and graphs. Secondly, I am a big fan of educational videos on YouTube which effectively make video essays to make arguments. I can foresee myself using my creative skills within video editing to make a video essay within the future. Based off these interests, if I were to pursuit an area of the digital humanities it would be data visualization. A project that I completed this year which exemplifies this area of digital humanities would be the collaborative project I participated in. The tool which my group and I researched and presented was Palladio. Palladio is a historical data visualization tool which features tools that visualize and compare time, geographical, and personal data. If I was to take this specialization into a career, I would love to analyse speech data. This could be very useful for example within politics where collecting and analysing politician rhetoric could give insight on how certain politicians convey their ideas or arguments differently.

##### *Abstract*

My selected media technology, the boombox, has been a piece of technology that I have used throughout my life in its many forms. From having an early 2000s Sony CD boombox to blast music with my cousins in my parent’s basement to my current Bluetooth Fluance speakers to fill my room with my favourite tunes, the boombox has been an important technology for how I have consumed music and other media. I was interested in researching the boombox because it was a technology which has evolved a great deal in the past 30 years. When I started researching the boombox, I realized how large of much of a manifestation of urban culture within the 90s. From this realization, I decided the main argument of my presentation would be that the boombox had a lasting impact on development of hip-hop, urban culture and portable audio devices. Although I was fascinated with the anthropology of the boombox, I wanted to bring a broad overview of the boombox’s past, present and future. From there I began researching and building my GitHub presentation. My first slides were to present the early history of the boombox to the class. These were to give context how and where the technology was developed and when it became popular, particularly within the United States. I then began touching on the boombox’s involvement in the development of hip-hop and urban culture. These slides established how the boombox heavily influenced urban society and vice versa with the boombox growing heavily to meet the demands for louder bass. The proceeding slides spoke about the development of the boombox’s design and technology during the height of its popularity. From there I spoke about the boombox’s significance and why it was such an influential piece of media technology. I then looked at the various forms which the boombox takes in present day such as wireless Bluetooth speakers. Lastly, I finished on comparing the boombox’s old and new forms as well as contrasting the difference for how music was consumed in the past to modern day. 

##### *Revision Statement*

After completing my presentation and having received a strong mark I was feeling well for how it went. When facing the task of choosing which project I was to feature as my revised project on my portfolio, I knew there were other projects that I perhaps could do more to revise, but my boombox presentation was the project which interested me the most and one which I wished to explore deeper. I already knew there were some improvements which were needed to be made to the slideshow, the main issue was the poor clarity of the text over the background pictures. Professor Christie assisted me in this issue by providing me with text-shadowing code to make all my text legible. Furthermore, other feedback which Professor Christie provided included: a greater focus of part 3 from the original outline (alternate trajectories of the boombox), expand more on the archeology of the media, and complete 5 more slides to make it the slideshow a proper 20x20 Pecha Kucha Presentation. I followed through by completing all these suggested improvements. I created slides, the first one titled “Alternative Paths of Development”, to talk about the different theoretical paths which technology could have developed. Some examples of such include: boombox shrinking in size to make it more portable or becoming more spherical to emit audio 360 degrees comparable with the design of the Beat’s Pill of today. I also delved into the archeology more of the boombox with my revisions. I created slides where I would talk about the development of the popularity of bass, why it became popular, and had the boombox not been there to provide its development, would music and culture be the same? Furthermore, I included a slide to touch on the development and importance of the boombox becoming a fashion item. The boombox was a early example of technology being a fashion item and made it possible for other technologies to become the same, this is evident in today’s society through headphones like Beat’s by Dre.

## Collaborative Project
##### *Project Discription*
During the collaborative project I participated in, I helped research and present my group’s digital humanities project, Palladio, a data analysis tool developed through Stanford University. Palladio is a robust historical data analysis tool which our group found to be a versatile tool which could visualize and compare data in interesting ways. The data our group used to demonstrate, collected by Aaron Coomber, was a collection of famous writers’ personal data including: death date, birthdate, place of death, place of birth, sex, name, occupation, and pictures. There were various fascinating visualizations we could find using the tool such as using Palladio’s map tool to demonstrate the distance between some writer’s place of birth and death. As great of a tool as Palladio is, we also discovered some issues with the tool.  Such issues can be evident in its failure to work properly is some internet browsers.

##### *Collaboration Statement*
How our group approached collaborative scholarship by having a steady line of communication both in-person and online. During the early meetings in class, my group and I discussed which tool we wanted to research and present. As a group, we split up the suggested digital humanities tools within the project outline to research. We each spoke about the tools we researched to rest of the group and whether it would be a good tool to present. After our group selected Palladio as our tool, we split up which areas of focus each of our group would cover. We decided everyone’s role based on what each of us interests and strengths. My role was to analyse and present Palladio’s Table, Gallery, Timeline and Timespan tools. I believe that collaboration is essential for thinking and working in an academic setting. Collaboration demands communication, organization, teamwork, leadership, and project management skills. These skills are vital, not only in academics, but also once I am within the workforce. Two digital tools I will typically use in collaborative tasks are Google Docs and Slides which make it easy for any group member to edit or add to any document or slideshow. Within the digital humanities, I make sure that there are clear lines of communication among fellow group members. This is the most important aspect of a collaborative project as with strong communication organization, teamwork and project management become much easier to achieve. With this approach to collaborative projects, I have found research and overall tasks much easier to complete. This is also evident for how collaborative projects fail which I have participated in. This is seen where some group members do not communicate with others which makes management, organization and functional teamwork extremely difficult.

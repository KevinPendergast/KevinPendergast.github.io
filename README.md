# Kevin Pendergast's IASC 2P02 
## Bio
  

  I am a 21 year old second year Interactive Arts and Science student attending Brock University. Currently, my interests within the digital humanities are within the creative side. I do not see myself graduating IASC with a concentration in Digital Scholarship, however there is many things I admire from the digital humanities which I would love to use for future projects. Firstly, using various visualizers to analyse statistics in various ways to demonstrate correlation and meaning for readers to better understand. This interest within digital visualization comes from my use of the website Last.fm which is a music listening tracker which has various tools to compile oneâ€™s listening history in different charts and graphs. Secondly, I am a big fan of educational videos on YouTube which effectively make video essays to make arguments. I can foresee myself using my creative skills within video editing to make a video essay within the future. Based off these interests, if I were to pursuit an area of the digital humanities it would be data visualization. A project that I completed this year which exemplifies this area of digital humanities would be the collaborative project I participated in. The tool which my group and I research and presented was Palladio. Palladio is a historical data visualization tool which features tools that visualize and compare time, geographical, and personal data. If I was to take this specialization into a career, I would love to analyse speech data. This could be very useful for example within politics where collecting and analysing politician rhetoric could give insight on how certain politicians convey their ideas or arguments differently.
